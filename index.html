<p>Ashiok has long, slender fingers with long talon-like claws for fingernails. The bottom half of Ashiok's head is normal—human, but the top half consists of two large black horns, made of some rough rocky substance, framing nothing. There is no upper face, no head, no eyes or nose. There is only black smoke emanating from where the mouth and upper lip ended. This black smoke whirles around Ashiok's head, swirling down in wider radius outside the body.[2] Ashiok refuses to be defined in terms of species or gender.</p>
